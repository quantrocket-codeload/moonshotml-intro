    "Machine learning strategies inherit from the `MoonshotML` class:\n",

    "`MoonshotML` is a subclass of the `Moonshot` class and shares much of its functionality. However, instead of defining a `prices_to_signals` method as with a standard Moonshot strategy, a machine learning strategy should define two methods for generating signals: `prices_to_features` and `predictions_to_signals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `prices_to_features` method takes a DataFrame of prices and should return a tuple of features and targets that will be used to train the machine learning model. In our demo strategy, we calculate each security's percent return over a variety of lookback windows as our set of features. For targets, we calculate whether the security's 1-month forward return is above or below the median 1-month forward return for all securities.\n",

    "The other method that is unique to `MoonshotML` is `predictions_to_signals`. After the model is trained on the features and targets from `prices_to_features` in the training period of the walk-forward optimization, the model is used to make predictions on new data in the subsequent test period. The model's predictions during the test period are fed to the `predictions_to_signals` method, where we use them to generate signals. In our demo strategy, we select the 3 stocks with the highest probability of outperforming the cross-sectional median and rebalance monthly:\n",

    "        \n",

    "        # Keep only the last signal of the month, then fill it forward\n",

    "        \n",
    "        return signals\n",
